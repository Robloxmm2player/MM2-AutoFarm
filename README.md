# MM2-AutoFarm
MM2 Summer Update AutoFarm (openSource)

# Cons:
* This does not autoexecute with the rounds you must manually run it when you have a weapon or the start timer is finished

* This program does not account for the fake coin Positions in the air bove each map
[sadly you will have to make your own gui script to log those positions]
